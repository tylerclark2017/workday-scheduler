# workday-scheduler
This workday scheduler project was meant to expose us to day.js as well as continue our practice with other third party APIs such as jQuery, and build upon our preexisting JavaScript knowledge. We had to use day.js to create the code that would enable the date to show on the webpage and update every 24 hours on a dddd, MMMM, D, YYYY format. I used jQuery to create the code specifically that would run after the browser loaded all the HTML elements, which included the dynamically created 12pm-5pm time blocks. I wrote code, alongside the Xpert Learning Assistant and tutor Mila Hose (who was very helpful!), to create the 12pm-5pm time blocks, as well as code that would save the user's input to local storage in the browser and store it to the time block, even when the user hit refresh. We also had to write code that would show the current hour in red, past hours in grey, and future hours in green to help organize the user's day.

The code source for this website is located in the index.html file inside the repository that is linked for this Challenge. I also utilized the Xpert Learning Assistant and, as previously mentioned, tutor Mila Hose, to help me finalize the code that is used to style each hour in grey, red, or green depending on the time (past, present, or future).
