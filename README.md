# workday-scheduler
This workday scheduler project was meant to expose us to day.js as well as other third party APIs such as jQuery, and build upon our preexisting JavaScript knowledge. We had to use day.js to create the code that would enable the date to show on the webpage, as well as update every 24 hours--on a dddd, MMMM, D, YYYY format. We used jQuery to create the code specifically that would run after the browser loaded all the HTML elements, which included the dynamically created 12pm-5pm time blocks. I wrote code, alongside the Xpert Learning Assistant, to create the 12pm-5pm time blocks, as well as code that would save the user's input to local storage in the browser.
